# My journey as an AR creator !!
Those who don’t know what Ar is, it refers to “Augmented Reality” where the virtual elements or objects are added to the reality, making it a very interesting domain to explore !!

Here’s an example of how Ar works, as you can see in this image below we can see that by adding an Ar element or object on your screen you can try different combination of how the object looks like to the environment.


My journey as an ar creator started in my first year of btech, since I am part of GDSC community in our college as a core team member, our club advisor presented this unique opportunity of how to start your journey in this field .

Sir introduced us with that program “Community of Metaverse” by the end of year and it was being organized by Meta and AICTE. These two names caught my eyes that time and I got interested since from my early age I also find these techs quite fascinating and through out this months long program we were taught by some big faces in the world of AR and their creativity was truly remarkable.

Now, that is all about what the program actually is but you’ll find this much more interesting if I just show you some of my AR effects ;)

Scan this Qr code :

It will open your instagram, and now point you insta camera towards the image :

Well they popped out of screen — Are they dancing on tap or not 😁 !!

— — and if the qr not working you can also see this effect page on my instagram : https://www.instagram.com/sharmaparag009/

There are some others ar effects too on my profile you can try them !

Now, to create these you’ll need only metaspark studio but your laptop or pc should meet the requirements as per the metaspark studio or your system will suffer just like mine :-)

The Metaspark Studio requires no coding to create these effects and it looks like this from the inside — just a sneak peak:


Well this is the crucks of what the program is and how I developed the effects and you might be the next !!
